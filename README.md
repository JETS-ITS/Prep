# Project-Week
The aim of this project is to help our client to convert from a BYOD policy to providing users with laptops they have picked out. The laptops will run either Windows 10 or Linux Ubuntu As both a backup software and local storage for large video files we will recommend Microsoft One Drive as backups can be scheduled and users can access the large video files while syncing progress to the One drive storage. The employees of our clients will use the Microsoft Teams software as an online workspace for collaboration and joint work on all projects of the client.
